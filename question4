Task 4: Explanation – CI/CD Benefits
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) streamline software delivery by automating repetitive tasks.

Automation: Every time code is pushed, the pipeline automatically builds and deploys the new version without manual intervention.

Faster Releases: Reduces time between code updates and deployment.

Error Reduction: Detects issues early through automated builds and tests.

Consistency: Ensures each deployment follows the same steps, avoiding “it works on my machine” problems.

Productivity: Developers focus on writing code instead of manual deployment.

In short, CI/CD ensures reliable, fast, and repeatable deployments, improving both development speed and software quality.
